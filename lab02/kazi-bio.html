        <p>
            Outside of my career so far, I like playing sports like tennis and soccer in my free time. I also play quite a lot of video games. I have a lot of favorite movies and TV shows but if I had to choose just one it would be How to Train your Dragon and Game of Thrones. I was also on the school e-sports team in my freshman year at SU.
