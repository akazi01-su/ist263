        The medieval form of tennis, referred to as real tennis was played around the 12th century and constantly evolved over time which was about 3 centuries. The game initially started off hitting a ball with a bare hand and then later moved to a glove, before finally using a racket to hit the ball. Real tennis is still a sport that is played especially in western Europe having a presence in England and France. They have courts at Lordâ€™s cricket ground which is also known as the home of cricket and one of the more famous real tennis clubs.

            The Birth of Lawn Tennis occurred sometime in the 18th century. The game has been constantly evolving ever since. An example of this is back when tennis was a relatively new sport, wooden rackets were used but now rackets are mainly made of graphite as wood proved to show structural limitations that limited racket swings.
